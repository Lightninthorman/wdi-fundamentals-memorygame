		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
		<p>A challenging game that will remind you of being a kid again! Where's the card you need, can you remember? More fun than frustrating, more exciting than watching paint dry. Hurray for fun times again!</p>
